Thuquhux is an experiment in creating a highly customizable sandbox 
game. It is only capable of displaying procedurally generated terrain
on a planet of arbitrary size (no larger than the sun), and rotating 
the planet so that differant parts of the terrain can be seen. 

We will try to add more features when we have time. Hopefully, the 
game will support non-trivial object deformation, some fluid dynamics,
and terrain modification. NPCs with pathfinding are also planned.
